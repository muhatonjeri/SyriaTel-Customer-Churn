    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel is one of the largest telecommunications providers in Syria, offering mobile services to a broad range of customers.  \n",
    "In the highly competitive telecom industry, retaining existing customers is critical for sustaining profitability and market share.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, customer churn — when subscribers discontinue using SyriaTel’s services — poses a significant business challenge.  \n",
    "Losing customers not only decreases revenue but also increases costs due to the need for acquiring new customers through marketing and promotional efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The key objective of this project is to develop a **predictive model** that accurately identifies customers likely to churn.  \n",
    "With such a model, SyriaTel will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take **proactive retention measures** for high-risk customers  \n",
    "- Design **targeted marketing campaigns**  \n",
    "- Improve **customer satisfaction** by addressing key pain points  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this will help **reduce churn rates**, save on customer acquisition costs, and maximize long-term profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 1.3 Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "| Stakeholder | Interest |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Executive Management** | Strategic decisions on customer retention initiatives |\n",
    "| **Marketing Team** | Design targeted offers and promotions |\n",
    "| **Customer Service** | Improve customer engagement and support |\n",
    "| **Data Science Team** | Develop and deploy predictive churn models |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Business Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "- Churn impacts both revenue and brand reputation.\n",
    "- The cost of acquiring a new customer is significantly higher than retaining an existing one.\n",
    "- The current challenge is **lack of early warning systems** for customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "By predicting churn probability, SyriaTel can intervene before losing the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build a classification model** using customer data to predict churn risk.\n",
    "- **Identify key drivers** (features) contributing to churn.\n",
    "- **Translate data insights into actionable business recommendations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6 Success Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Performance:** Achieve an acceptable balance between precision and recall (using classification metrics like F1-score).\n",
    "- **Business Impact:** Provide insights that SyriaTel’s marketing and customer success teams can implement.\n",
    "- **Actionable Insights:** Highlight features that are strong predictors of churn to inform business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.7 Project Scope and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model will be based on historical customer data available at the time of this project.\n",
    "- Predictions will be probabilistic — they suggest likelihood, not certainty.\n",
    "- Results and recommendations are constrained by the quality and depth of the dataset provided.\n",

    "  - Demographics (e.g., gender, age group)\n",
    "  - Account Information (e.g., contract type, payment method)\n",
    "  - Service Usage Patterns (e.g., data usage, call minutes)\n",
    "  - Subscription details (e.g., international plan, voicemail plan)\n",
