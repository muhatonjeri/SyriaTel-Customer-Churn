    "### Business Problem\n",
    "SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications provider, is facing significant revenue loss due to customer churn — the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services. In the highly competitive telecom sector, acquiring new customers is costly, making customer retention a top strategic priority.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing churn requires a clear understanding of the factors that influence customer behavior and the ability to anticipate churn before it happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model that classifies whether a customer is likely to churn. By leveraging customer demographic and usage data, the model will empower SyriaTel to:\n",
    "- Identify at-risk customers\n",
    "- Implement targeted retention strategies\n",
    "- Optimize marketing efforts\n",
    "- Reduce overall churn rates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "- **Customer Retention & Loyalty Team** — Responsible for designing and executing churn reduction programs.\n",
    "- **Marketing Strategy Team** — Focused on customer engagement and acquisition strategies.\n",
    "- **Senior Management** — Interested in high-level insights for strategic planning and revenue assurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Business Questions\n",
    "- What customer attributes and behaviors are strong indicators of churn?\n",
    "- How accurately can churn be predicted before it occurs?\n",
    "- What actionable insights can SyriaTel apply to minimize customer attrition?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview  \n",
    "The dataset contains historical customer information from SyriaTel, including demographics, account information, usage patterns, and churn status.  \n",
    "Our goal in this phase is to understand the structure of the data, inspect column details, assess data quality, and identify potential issues for cleaning and preparation.\n",
